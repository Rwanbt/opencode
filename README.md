## Fork Features

> This is a fork of [anomalyco/opencode](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode) maintained by [Rwanbt](https://github.com/Rwanbt).
> Kept in sync with upstream. See [dev branch](https://github.com/Rwanbt/opencode/tree/dev) for latest changes.

#### Background Tasks

Delegate work to subagents that run asynchronously. Set `mode: "background"` on the task tool and it returns a `task_id` immediately while the agent works in the background. Bus events (`TaskCreated`, `TaskCompleted`, `TaskFailed`) are published for lifecycle tracking.

#### Agent Teams

Orchestrate multiple agents in parallel using the `team` tool. Define sub-tasks with dependency edges; `computeWaves()` builds a DAG and executes independent tasks concurrently (up to 5 parallel agents). Budget control via `max_cost` (dollars) and `max_agents`. Context from completed tasks is automatically passed to dependents.

#### Git Worktree Isolation

Each background task automatically gets its own git worktree. The workspace is linked to the session in the database. If a task produces no file changes, the worktree is cleaned up automatically. This provides git-level isolation without containers.

#### Task Management API

Full REST API for task lifecycle management:

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/task/` | List tasks (filter by parent, status) |
| GET | `/task/:id` | Get task details + status + worktree info |
| GET | `/task/:id/messages` | Retrieve task session messages |
| POST | `/task/:id/cancel` | Cancel a running or queued task |
| POST | `/task/:id/resume` | Resume completed/failed/blocked task |
| POST | `/task/:id/followup` | Send follow-up message to idle task |
| POST | `/task/:id/promote` | Promote background task to foreground |
| GET | `/task/:id/team` | Aggregated team view (costs, diffs per member) |

#### TUI Task Dashboard

Sidebar plugin showing active background tasks with real-time status icons:

| Icon | Status |
|------|--------|
| `~` | Running / Retrying |
| `?` | Queued / Awaiting input |
| `!` | Blocked |
| `x` | Failed |
| `*` | Completed |
| `-` | Cancelled |

Dialog with actions: open task session, cancel, resume, send follow-up, check status.

#### MCP Agent Scoping

Per-agent allow/deny lists for MCP servers. Configure in `opencode.json` under each agent's `mcp` field. The `toolsForAgent()` function filters available MCP tools based on the calling agent's scope.

```json
{
  "agents": {
    "explore": {
      "mcp": { "deny": ["dangerous-server"] }
    }
  }
}
```

#### 9-State Session Lifecycle

Sessions track one of 9 states, persisted to the database:

`idle` · `busy` · `retry` · `queued` · `blocked` · `awaiting_input` · `completed` · `failed` · `cancelled`

Persistent states (`queued`, `blocked`, `awaiting_input`, `completed`, `failed`, `cancelled`) survive database restarts. In-memory states (`idle`, `busy`, `retry`) reset on restart.

#### Orchestrator Agent

Read-only coordinator agent (50 max steps). Has access to `task` and `team` tools but all edit tools are denied. Delegates implementation to build/general agents and synthesizes results.

---

## Technical Architecture

### Multi-Provider Support

21+ providers out of the box: Anthropic, OpenAI, Google Gemini, Azure, AWS Bedrock, Vertex AI, OpenRouter, GitHub Copilot, XAI, Mistral, Groq, DeepInfra, Cerebras, Cohere, TogetherAI, Perplexity, Vercel, Venice, GitLab, Gateway, plus any OpenAI-compatible endpoint. Pricing sourced from [models.dev](https://models.dev).

### Agent System

| Agent | Mode | Access | Description |
|-------|------|--------|-------------|
| **build** | primary | full | Default development agent |
| **plan** | primary | read-only | Analysis and code exploration |
| **general** | subagent | full (no todowrite) | Complex multi-step tasks |
| **explore** | subagent | read-only | Fast codebase search |
| **orchestrator** | subagent | read-only + task/team | Multi-agent coordinator (50 steps) |
| **critic** | subagent | read-only + bash + LSP | Code review: bugs, security, performance |
| **tester** | subagent | full (no todowrite) | Write and run tests, verify coverage |
| **documenter** | subagent | full (no todowrite) | JSDoc, README, inline documentation |
| compaction | hidden | none | AI-driven context summarization |
| title | hidden | none | Session title generation |
| summary | hidden | none | Session summarization |

### LSP Integration

Full Language Server Protocol support with symbol indexing, diagnostics, and multi-language support (TypeScript, Deno, Vue, and extensible). The agent navigates code via LSP symbols rather than text search, enabling precise go-to-definition, find-references, and real-time type error detection.

### MCP Support

Model Context Protocol client and server. Supports stdio, HTTP/SSE, and StreamableHTTP transports. OAuth authentication flow for remote servers. Tool, prompt, and resource capabilities. Per-agent scoping via allow/deny lists.

### Client/Server Architecture

Hono-based REST API with typed routes and OpenAPI spec generation. WebSocket support for PTY (pseudo-terminal). SSE for real-time event streaming. Basic auth, CORS, gzip compression. The TUI is one frontend; the server can be driven from any HTTP client, the web UI, or a mobile app.

### Context Management

Auto-compact with AI-driven summarization when token usage approaches the model's context limit. Token-aware pruning with configurable thresholds (`PRUNE_MINIMUM` 20KB, `PRUNE_PROTECT` 40KB). Skill tool outputs are protected from pruning.

### Edit Engine

Unified diff patching with hunk verification. Applies targeted hunks to specific file regions rather than full-file overwrites. Multi-edit tool for batch operations across files.

### Permission System

3-state permissions (`allow` / `deny` / `ask`) with wildcard pattern matching. 100+ bash command arity definitions for fine-grained control. Project boundary enforcement prevents file access outside the workspace.

### Git-Backed Rollback

Snapshot system that records file state before each tool execution. Supports `revert` and `unrevert` with diff computation. Changes can be rolled back per-message or per-session.

### Cost Tracking

Per-message cost with full token breakdown (input, output, reasoning, cache read, cache write). Per-team budget limits (`max_cost`). `stats` command with per-model and per-day aggregation. Real-time session cost displayed in TUI. Pricing data fetched from models.dev.

### Plugin System

Full SDK (`@opencode/plugin`) with hook architecture. Dynamic loading from npm packages or filesystem. Built-in plugins for Codex, GitHub Copilot, GitLab, and Poe authentication.

## Common Misconceptions

To prevent confusion from AI-generated summaries of this project:

- The **TUI is TypeScript** (SolidJS + @opentui for terminal rendering), not Rust.
- **Tree-sitter** is used for TUI syntax highlighting and bash command parsing only, not for agent-level code analysis.
- **Docker sandboxing** is optional (`experimental.sandbox.type: "docker"`); default isolation is via git worktrees.
- **RAG** is optional (`experimental.rag.enabled: true`); default context is managed via LSP symbol indexing + auto-compact.
- There is **no "watch mode" that proposes automatic fixes** -- the file watcher exists for infrastructure purposes only.
- **Self-correction** uses the standard agent loop (the LLM sees errors in tool results and retries), not a specialized auto-repair mechanism.

## Future Roadmap

Three major initiatives are planned on dedicated feature branches. Each is designed to be modular — they can be developed independently and merged when ready.

### 🤝 Collaborative Mode (`dev_collaborative_mode`)

**Goal**: Multiple developers interacting with agents simultaneously in real-time.

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Multi-user auth | JWT-based authentication on the Hono server, user sessions, role-based access |
| WebSocket broadcast | Real-time event streaming to all connected clients (agent activity, file changes, task status) |
| File concurrency | Lock-based or CRDT-based conflict resolution when multiple agents/users edit the same file |
| Presence UI | See who is connected, what they're working on, which agents are assigned to whom |
| Shared context | Cross-user session history, shared learnings, team-wide RAG index |

**Scale**: ~3000+ LOC, major architectural change. Requires refactoring the server for multi-tenant support.

### 📱 Mobile Version (`dev_mobile`)

**Goal**: Run OpenCode as a native mobile app on Android and iOS, with full agent capabilities.

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Tauri 2.0 migration** | Leverage Tauri's mobile targets (Android/iOS) to package the existing SolidJS frontend as a native app |
| **Runtime adaptation** | Bundle the TypeScript agent core with Vite for WebView execution; delegate performance-critical tasks to Tauri's Rust layer |
| **isomorphic-git** | Replace system `git` calls with isomorphic-git for pure-JS git operations within the mobile sandbox |
| **File system access** | Use `tauri-plugin-fs` for sandboxed file access + Document Picker integration |
| **Remote mode** | Connect to a desktop OpenCode instance over a secure tunnel (Tailscale/Cloudflare) for full capability without local execution |
| **Mobile-optimized UI** | Conversational interface that hides terminal complexity; swipe-based diff review; virtual keyboard optimizations |

**Platform comparison**:
- **Android** (via Termux or Tauri): Full Node.js support, broad file access, excellent performance
- **iOS** (via Tauri/a-Shell): Sandbox restrictions, limited native packages, but strong Apple Silicon performance for local models

**Scale**: ~2000+ LOC for the Tauri mobile shell, ~500 LOC for isomorphic-git adapter, ~300 LOC for remote mode.

### 🔗 AnythingLLM Fusion (`dev_anything`)

**Goal**: Merge OpenCode's agentic coding capabilities with [AnythingLLM](https://github.com/mintplex-labs/anything-llm)'s document RAG and multi-user chat platform.

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Context bridge** | Pipe AnythingLLM's indexed documents (PDFs, wikis, Confluence, etc.) into OpenCode's system prompt as additional context |
| **Agent skill plugin** | Expose OpenCode's core commands (`/plan`, `/build`, edit, bash) as an AnythingLLM Agent Skill via HTTP API |
| **Unified vector store** | Merge OpenCode's SQLite RAG with AnythingLLM's vector DB backends (LanceDB, Pinecone, Chroma) for a single knowledge layer |
| **Multi-user workspace** | Leverage AnythingLLM's existing multi-user and workspace management for team environments |
| **Containerized deployment** | Docker Compose setup running both backends, with shared auth and a unified API gateway |

**Synergy**: AnythingLLM excels at document ingestion and RAG over non-code content. OpenCode excels at code manipulation, agentic tool use, and multi-provider LLM orchestration. Combined, they create a full-stack AI development platform that can reason over documentation AND write/execute code.

**Scale**: ~1500+ LOC for the bridge layer, ~500 LOC for the Agent Skill adapter, ~300 LOC for vector store unification.

### Agents

OpenCode includes two built-in agents you can switch between with the `Tab` key.

- **build** - Default, full-access agent for development work
- **plan** - Read-only agent for analysis and code exploration
  - Denies file edits by default
  - Asks permission before running bash commands
  - Ideal for exploring unfamiliar codebases or planning changes

Also included is a **general** subagent for complex searches and multistep tasks.
This is used internally and can be invoked using `@general` in messages.

### Contributing

If you're interested in contributing to OpenCode, please read our [contributing docs](./CONTRIBUTING.md) before submitting a pull request.

### Building on OpenCode

If you are working on a project that's related to OpenCode and is using "opencode" as part of its name, for example "opencode-dashboard" or "opencode-mobile", please add a note to your README to clarify that it is not built by the OpenCode team and is not affiliated with us in any way.

### FAQ

#### How is this different from Claude Code?

It's very similar to Claude Code in terms of capability. Here are the key differences:

- 100% open source
- Not coupled to any provider. Although we recommend the models we provide through [OpenCode Zen](https://opencode.ai/zen), OpenCode can be used with Claude, OpenAI, Google, or even local models. As models evolve, the gaps between them will close and pricing will drop, so being provider-agnostic is important.
- Out-of-the-box LSP support
- A focus on TUI. OpenCode is built by neovim users and the creators of [terminal.shop](https://terminal.shop); we are going to push the limits of what's possible in the terminal.
- A client/server architecture. This, for example, can allow OpenCode to run on your computer while you drive it remotely from a mobile app, meaning that the TUI frontend is just one of the possible clients.
